# Bus Management System

In this project we wrote a system for managing an information system for public transportation.

The underlying idea is that the passenger can book bus rides to bus stops from a list of defined stations.

The system was built as described:

• Managing information about the maintenance of transportation vehicles (buses) used for travel

• Managing information about the different lines the company must operate


The project involved practice and implementation of:

• Language Principles of C#

• Software design templates:

  - Architecture (Layer Model, Contract Design))
  - Manufacturers (Singleton, Simple Factory)
  - Behavioral (Observer, Iterator))
  
• Create a user interface using the modern open infrastructure WPF

• Create databases of lines and stations

• Threads

• Work with external files (in XML).

• Teamwork

• Programmatic thinking and self-learning
