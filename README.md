# Bus Management System &#128652;

In this project we wrote a system for managing an information system for public transportation.

The underlying idea is that the passenger can book bus rides to bus stops from a list of defined stations.

The system was built as described:

&#9981; Managing information about the maintenance of transportation vehicles (buses) used for travel

&#128653; Managing information about the different lines the company must operate

&#128655; Managing information about the different stations


The project involved practice and implementation of:

&#128187; Language Principles of C#

:gem: Software design templates:

  - Architecture (Layer Model, Contract Design))
  - Manufacturers (Singleton, Simple Factory)
  - Behavioral (Observer, Iterator))
  
:art: Create a user interface using the modern open infrastructure WPF

:bookmark_tabs: Create databases of lines and stations

&#128194; Work with external files (in XML).

:busts_in_silhouette: Teamwork

:brain: Programmatic thinking and self-learning
